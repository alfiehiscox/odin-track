# odin-track 

Simplest way I could think of adding a default tracking allocator to my odin projects. 

Just one file and a copy command. 

I tend to `alias` the bash script to `odin-track` so I can just initialise a working directory with 
the tracking allocator. 

## Future Ideas 

- Adding valgrind to have better profiling/debugging
- Custom tracking allocator that outputs to log file
